## Insights through R

#### The Car_Sales Dataset Visualized Using R

#### Visualization 1 - Scatterplot: Analyzing Engine Size, Horsepower, and Fuel Efficiency

##### In the R analysis, it was found that engine size and horsepower have a positive correlation, indicating that larger engines tend to have higher horsepower. Conversely, there's a negative correlation between engine size and fuel efficiency, suggesting that larger engines generally have lower fuel efficiency. This implies a trade-off between horsepower and fuel efficiency. Outliers, like a single data point with a large engine size and low fuel efficiency, were also noted, indicating exceptions to the general trend and warranting further investigation.

#### Visualization 2 - Box Plot: Fuel Efficiency: Cars vs. Passenger Vehicles

##### The comparison chart illustrates fuel efficiency differences between cars and passenger vehicles. Cars show a more uniform distribution without outliers, while passenger vehicles have some unusual data points. Both categories have similar box widths, but passenger vehicles appear to have a longer box, indicating greater variability in fuel efficiency. Cars exhibit tightly clustered fuel efficiency values within a narrower range, emphasizing greater consistency compared to passenger vehicles.

#### Visualization 3 - Histogram: Understanding Fuel Efficiency Distribution in Cars

##### The majority of cars exhibit fuel efficiency values ranging from 20 to 30, indicating a central tendency towards this range. There are fewer cars with fuel efficiency values below 20 or above 30, suggesting a less common occurrence of extreme values. Additionally, a smaller group of cars demonstrates slightly higher efficiency values beyond 45. The shape of the histogram curve illustrates that the most prevalent fuel efficiencies cluster around 20 to 30, gradually decreasing as efficiency values increase beyond this range.
